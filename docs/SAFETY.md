# Safety

`multi-bot-agentic` treats the LLM as an input source, not an authority. Model outputs are consumed as observations, then a deterministic decision engine chooses the next action.

## Controls

- **Bounded scope**: prompts are capped by `max_prompt_chars`.
- **Bounded runtime**: runs stop at `max_steps`.
- **Timeouts**: each provider call has a timeout.
- **Cancellation**: a cancellation file can stop a run before the next action.
- **Tool allowlist**: tools must be registered and allowed by policy.
- **Rationale traces**: every decision records matched rule IDs, inputs used, and rejected actions.

## Provider Credentials

Credentials are read from environment variables and are never written to the event log. Event payloads store normalized provider output text and metadata, not secret values.
